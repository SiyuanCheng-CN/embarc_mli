Getting Started
===============

The MLI library provides a basic set of functions running on the ARC
EM DSP and HS cores. It is intended to solve typical machine learning
tasks in a portable or low-power system. This library is designed
with ease of use and low overhead in mind.
   
.. _bld_lib:

Build Library
-------------

By default, the embARC MLI Library can be built for ``/hw/em9d.tcf`` that is based on 
the standard EM9D Voice Audio template, defined in MetaWare Development Tools with extended 
XY memory. The embARC MLI Library can be also built for a specific EM or HS configuration.

Build requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MetaWare Development tools 2018.12 or later

Build Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To verify the build process, run the following root makefile command
to rebuild the project from scratch including  ELF for examples and static library:

.. code-block:: console

   $ gmake all
   
..

After the build process completes, the output files are found inside
the bin directory created by the make tool:

On Windows:
   
.. code-block:: console

   > dir /b /s \*.elf \*.a
..

On Linux:
   
.. code-block:: console

   $ find -name ‘\*.a’ -o -name ‘\*.elf’
..

Expected console output on windows is next:: 

.\bin\libmli.a
.\examples\example_cifar10_caffe\bin\example_cifar10_caffe.elf
.\examples\example_har_smartphone\bin\example_har_smartphone.elf
.\examples\example_face_detect\bin\example_face_trigger.elf

Note: example_kws_speech is not included into general build rule as it requires extra steps 
before building. Please refer to ``example_kws_speech/README.md`` for build information.   

The project build system allows to build the library and examples separately. 
Library and each example have a separate makefile which uses common rules from ``build/rules.mk``.
To build the embARC MLI library defined by a TCF file, use the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ gmake all TCF_FILE=C:\ARC\Projects\my_project\build\tool_config\arc.tcf

..

Optional Parameters for Target Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
The Build system supports a common set of optional parameters to configure the target platform, 
output/intermediate files placement, and provides extra parameters to build tool or application.

Build and Run Examples

Build Debug Version of Library Using Custom TCF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the debug version of the library using the custom TCF and
to store the output file in the directory outside the project, use the
following commands:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd lib\make
   $ gmake TCF_FILE=C:\ARC\Projects\my_project\build\tool_config\arc.tcf EXT_CFLAGS=-g LIBRARY_DIR=C:\bin

..
   
Example applications also provide the separate makefiles to make the
customized applications build.

Build Debug Version of Example Application Using Custom TCF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the debug version of the ``cifar10_caffe`` example application
using the custom TCF, use the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd examples\example_cifar10_caffe
   $ gmake TCF_FILE=C:\ARC\Projects\my_project\build\tool_config\arc.tcf EXT_CFLAGS=-g

..

Example application makefiles support the target run to execute the
application using the NSIM simulator. Note that this target
requires the TCF name to be provided to setup the simulation
environment.

Build and Simulate Debug Version of Example Application Using Custom TCF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build ``cifar10_caffe`` example application using the custom TCF and
starting the simulation, use the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd examples\example_cifar10_caffe
   $ gmake TCF_FILE=C:\ARC\Projects\my_project\build\tool_config\arc.tcf
   $ gmake run TCF_FILE=C:\ARC\Projects\my_project\build\tool_config\arc.tcf
