Element-wise Group
------------------

The Element-wise Group describes operations that are applied element-by-element on two tensors of the same shape and return a tensor of same shape. The kernels can also be used for broadcasting a scalar value. One of the input tensors can be a scalar tensor. In that case the operation is applied to the scalar value and each element of the other tensor. 
〖out〗_i=operation(〖in〗_i^1,〖in〗_i^2)
〖out〗_i=operation(〖in〗_scalar^1,〖in〗_i^2)
Kernels which implement Element-wise functions have the following prototype:
mli_status mli_krn_eltwise_<operation>_<datatype> (
   const mli_tensor *in1,
   const mli_tensor *in2,
   mli_tensor *out);
